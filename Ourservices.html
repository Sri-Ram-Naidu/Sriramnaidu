Big data is a term that describes the large volume of data – both structured and 
unstructured – that inundates a business on a day-to-day basis. But it’s not the amount of data
 that’s important. It’s what organizations do with the data that matters. Big data can be analyzed for
 insights that lead to better decisions and strategic business moves.</p>

Java is a programming language and computing platform first released by Sun Microsystems in 1995.
 There are lots of applications and websites that will not work unless you have Java installed, and more are created every day.
 Java is fast, secure, and reliable. From laptops to datacenters, game consoles to scientific supercomputers, 
cell phones to the Internet, Java is everywhere!</p>

<p><a name="IOT1">Iot</a>
Internet of Things (IoT) is an ecosystem of connected physical objects that are accessible through the internet. 
The ‘thing’ in IoT could be a person with a heart monitor or an automobile with built-in-sensors, 
i.e. objects that have been assigned an IP address and have the ability to collect and transfer data over a network without manual assistance or intervention. 
The embedded technology in the objects helps them to interact with internal states or the external environment, which in turn affects the decisions taken.</p>

<p><a name="Artificial">
Artificial intelligence (AI) makes it possible for machines to learn from experience, 
adjust to new inputs and perform human-like tasks. Most AI examples that you hear about today – from chess-playing computers to self-driving cars – rely heavily on
 deep learning and natural language processing. Using these technologies, computers can be trained to accomplish specific tasks by processing large amounts 
of data and recognizing patterns in the data.</p>
